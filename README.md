# Auto Scroll Chrome Extension

Auto Scroll is a simple Chrome extension that allows users to automatically scroll to the bottom of a webpage at a fixed interval. This can be helpful for loading new content on webpages that utilize infinite scrolling.

## Features

- Start and stop buttons for controlling the auto-scroll behavior
- Automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page every second

## Installation

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the Auto Scroll extension files.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage you want to auto-scroll.
2. Click on the Auto Scroll extension icon to open the popup.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate auto-scrolling. The page will scroll to the bottom every second, triggering infinite scroll loading for new content.
4. To stop auto-scrolling, click the "Stop" button in the popup.

## Limitations and Improvements

- The basic extension may not work correctly on all websites, as some may use different scrolling and loading mechanisms.
- Possible improvements include adding customizable scroll speeds, displaying the current status (started or stopped) in the popup, and adding specific rules for certain websites.
